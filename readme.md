## TNaLaGmes

TNaLaGmes is a Toolbox for Natural Language Games

I asked myself, what if random python objects could talk to you using only natural language?

TNaLaGmes is a library that provides tools and default models for a variety of constructs, it was made thinking about games, but it really is about text enabling random code constructs!
